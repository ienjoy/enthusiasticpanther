# Enthusiastic Panter is a made-up band

We make up songs, then make up playlists, then play those made-up playlists at made-up shows. Then we analyse the stats!

## Getting started

You need to add a config.php file to the main directory, then type your db config stuff inside it:


	
$username = "username";  
$password = "yourpassword";  
$db = "yourdatabase";
