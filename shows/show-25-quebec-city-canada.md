##Review
No performance of Reload, but the other two songs that comprise The Big Three bookended the show. Blue Orange brought the house down with a 78/100, and the last song of the night broke records by hitting 100/100. It was the perfect performance.

But not content to leave on a high note, the band plunged into their most polarising song, The Wave. It scored a mere 29/100, stealing the chance for the band to leave on the highest possible note.

Also of note: the gap score for The Wave was 9, which is quite high for any song, let alone a song that has a whole fandom dedicated to it.
