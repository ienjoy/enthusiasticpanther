The Auckland show started with this stirring cry: "Our drummer says we shouldn't start concerts with new songs, so let's prove him wrong!" It turns out the drummer was right. The debut of Top didn't go very well, and it wasn't until the band returned to crowd pleasers Ticket and Blue Orange that the show found its footing.
