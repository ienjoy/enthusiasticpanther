##Review
The band decided to play a trick on the drummer, and leads the whole show with Duke's Revenge. Torn between putting on a good show and standing up for himself, he ends up playing along.

The Wave delights a small percentage of "Wavers" in the audience, but drags down the show. A decent showing, but not great.
