“We have a curse! We have to stop debuting songs at the front of the show!” the drummer yelled backstage.  
“We don’t have a curse,” the singer said. “Lilliput is going to work, trust me.”

It did not work. To salvage the show, the band played The Big Three as a triad in the middle of the show. That works, and in fact the band registers their best show to date. Morale is running high after this show, but there continues to be a debate within the band about the “always start with a new song” strategy.
