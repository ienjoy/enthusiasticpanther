##Review
No one in the band had been to Invercargill before, so they wrote a song specifically for the audience. The crowd was polite, but it was clear they didn't like the song much. The band managed to salvage the show with Reload and a big Blue Orange closer.

After this show, the band openly debated whether or not it was smart to always debut new songs at the beginning of a concert. In the end, the lead singer decided they'd keep it up, leading to some discontent within the band on the trip to Auckland.
