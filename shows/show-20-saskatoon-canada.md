##Review
This show found the band discovering a “new floor” in their ratings. Nearly every song was red, yet the overall score was still pretty good at 62/100.

The Big Three makes an appearance, alongside a solid debut of A9 and a generous sampling of new songs. Buzz online started to really kick up around this time. Was the band going to keep relying on the same Big Three lineup to carry every show, or would they make an attempt to be more adventurous?
