##Review
The band stormed into Hamilton hungry for a good show, and agreed on playing the "Big Three" to help them achieve that. Despite pleading from the drummer, who believed that their "always start with a new song" strategy was jinxing entire shows, the band started with Waiting for Fred.

It did not go well. But despite that mistake, the show ended up with the highest rating yet. And what do you do after a great show? If you're this band, you get in a giant fight and break up.
