##Review
There's no way to explain it other than to say Enthusiastic Panther played a rock opera, based on a new fantasy story, with all new songs. It was reminiscent of their Missoula show, but this time with an entire story based on a fantasy world.

Absolutely amazing show. Hard to process. More to come.


Show freshness: 88/100 (100/100)
