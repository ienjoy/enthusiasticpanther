##Review

This concert was arranged at the last minute with a cryptic poster. Online sleuths quickly determined that the “stars and moons” motif in the flag was morse code that spelled out “New Album,” which led to a lot of anticipation leading up to the show.

Even casual fans of the band know that the band has no studio albums, only recordings of live shows. This made the hint “New Album” all the more mysterious. Shouldn’t you have a first album before you can call the next one new?

The concert kicked off with a new song called F-12, but was then followed up with five more, for a total of six brand new songs from the band. The Big Three didn’t make an appearance, and neither did any of their other songs. For people new to the band, it was an average show. But for EP’s rabid fan base, it was an instant classic.

The stand-out songs of the night were in the middle of the show: Midst, High School, and Patrick Swayze. The rendition of Guyute was technically a cover, but thoroughly reworked to feel like a fully EP song.

With that, the short US leg of the tour was over. Up next: Canada!
