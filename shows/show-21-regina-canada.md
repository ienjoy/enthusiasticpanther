##Review
You win some, you lose some. The band has friends in Regina and wanted to put on a great show, but it wasn’t to be. Despite a 50/50 split between red and blue songs, the song selection doomed the show to a disappointing 56/100 score. It didn’t help that they played Needle, the worst song in the entire catalog, which recorded a terrible 14/100.

On the positive side, the newer songs Patrick Swayze and Midst stood out with real potential. Both songs were written by the bassist, which raised a few eyebrows amongst the others in the band.
