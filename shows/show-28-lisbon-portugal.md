##Review

An absolute stunner of a show. Other than a completely botched version of The Turning Machine, the show was almost exclusively blue songs. There was a good blend of older songs alongside Halifax Lore, plus a good blend of rare songs to go alongside the common ones. A fantastic show and a good sign for the rest of the European tour.
