##Review

The band had supporting help for this show from [The Plodes](https://theplodes.bandcamp.com/) and [Bad Hoo](https://badhoo.bandcamp.com). All three bands ended up hanging out backstage where EP learned how to play Little Bones by The Tragically Hip. They figured it out well enough to debut the concert with it, or so they thought. It went ok, but not as well as they were hoping for.

The crowd was mostly there to see Bad Hoo, so the audience reaction was mostly muted. However, the energy changed drastically when the band decided to play The Big Three to close out the night. Reload came first, and was ok. But next came what fanthers have come to call "Victoria Ticket," an almost-flawless performance that went down as the best song they had ever played.

In the end, Victoria ended up scoring as the third best show in EP's entire concert chronology. But it was the performance of Ticket that became an instant classic, as buzz in Canada began to get louder. Afterwards, Bad Hoo invited Enthusiastic Panther to play with them in Calgary. EP agreed, and it was a good thing they did!
