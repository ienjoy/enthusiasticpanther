##Review

Call it stage fright, call it hubris, call it bad luck. This was a bad show.

The band attempted to put together a show without the help of any of The Big Three. Unsurprisingly the show was a disaster, tying for the second worst show of all time. The only highlight was High School, but even it was played below its expected average.
