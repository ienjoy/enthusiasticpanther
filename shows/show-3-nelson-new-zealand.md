This could have been a breakout show for Enthusiastic Panther if it weren't for, well, every song except Ticket and Reload. The audience was left scratching their heads. "How could those two songs be so good when the rest of their set was absolute shite?"

Over time, Ticket and Reload emerge as two of the most popular songs of the entire band's catalog. And the other ones? Bad news, they never stop being shite.
