Dunedin taught the band an important lesson. Reload and Ticket are popular anywhere in the set, and ... The Wave is just not a good song, and nothing can be done to save it.

The band was riding high on a great show and approaching an epic close when the bassist got a bit cocky. When he plucked out the first few notes for The Wave, the rest of the band groaned, but gamely soldiered on. They shouldn't have.

It turns out a bad performance of a bad song doesn't work very well as a closing song! Who knew?
