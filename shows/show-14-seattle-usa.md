##Review
The curse of the debut song continued in the Emerald City. Needle was a new song inspired by the Pacific Northwest, and the band was excited to try it out. But halfway through its maiden performance, the crowd booed until the band stopped the song.

Lilliput didn’t fare much better, but Sure punched way above its weight to save the show, then the Big Three closed out the night on a high note.

This concert is emblematic of the kind of rut the band began to get into. New, adventurous songs weren’t being received well while older, more played out songs were getting huge responses. Increasingly the band began to resent those crowd pleasing songs but didn’t feel they had any choice.
