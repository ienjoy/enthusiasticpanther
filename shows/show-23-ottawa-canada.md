##Review
A few notable things about this show. Our 27th Song debuted, then there was a red streak of three, and a blue streak of five. The Big Three made an appearance, and the show was good overall.

It also kicked off the first recording of the "SLF score" which stands for "Setlist Freshness." This score describes how old or new the songs are. A score above 75% would mean the show is mostly new songs (as in Missoula) and a score below 25% would mean it's mostly older songs. This show scored a 49, right in the middle. Song oldies, some new songs.


Setlist freshness: 49/100
