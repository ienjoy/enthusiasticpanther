##Review
The Christchurch show was the best show played by the band to date, and it brought with it a lot of interesting data and lore.

First, the band debuted a full three songs, meaning more than half the show was brand new. Second, the band decided in Christchurch that because the new songs were received well, any show with new music would always begin with a new song. Third, Ticket and Reload brought the house down, which is where the band realised these two songs were their crowd favourites, and work best later in the set.

The next show was going to be played further south, in Dunedin. The band decided to put some of their new theories to the test.
