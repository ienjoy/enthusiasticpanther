##Review
The best show EP had ever played, for a lot of reasons.

First off, every song over-performed. Most concerts have a blend of songs performed worse than their average ("red songs") and songs performed better ("blue songs"). On this evening, every single song came up blue.

Then, Blue Orange scored 98/100, breaking the record set the night before and registering almost a perfect score. Then Ticket did almost as well with a 97/100 score. And if that weren't enough, Reload's 93/100 meant that 3 of the best 4 performances of all time were in a single concert.

Interestingly enough, Enthusiastic Panther didn't even headline this show! This was actually a [Bad Hoo](https://badhoo.bandcamp.com) show, with EP just doing their best to warm up the crowd. No one was more surprised about the great performance than Enthusiastic Panther themselves!

"We should always be an opening act," the drummer joked. He might not have been joking.
