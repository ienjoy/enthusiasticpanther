##Review
Yet another solid Canadian show. Interestingly enough, the show started with Blue Orange and ended with Reload, and they both recorded the same astonishing 91/100 score. Ticket made an appearance in the middle of the set, completing a Big Three spotting.

The fanthers circulating live footage of these shows continued to split into two camps. Some thought it was great to hear The Big Three so frequently, others thought the band was being too lazy to rely so heavily on them.

If the band knew about the controversy, they weren’t showing it. “On to the next show!” became their unofficial mantra through this trek. The Canada leg was turning into something special, and they wanted to keep it up without thinking too hard about it.
