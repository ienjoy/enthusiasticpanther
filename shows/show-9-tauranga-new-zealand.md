##Review
The band stayed broken up for about three months. Just as the band was considering making some new songs, their tour manager said he had tracked down some shows in the United States and Canada and wanted to know if the band was interested.

The answer was unanimous: Yes! Of course! Before leaving on their grand adventure, they played one last night in their home country before traveling abroad. They all agreed they'd need to go out on a high note.

They did not. It was a bad show. The drummer pointed out that it was probably because they started the show with a new song (this time a cover of a Year Unknown track), and was told to stop whinging.
